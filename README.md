# Haskell Sort Function: A Deeper Look

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Haskell's built-in `sort` function, highlighting its complexity and potential for unexpected behavior. The `bug.hs` file contains a seemingly straightforward example of sorting a list of integers.  However, the issue becomes apparent when dealing with more complex data types or when the comparison function is not carefully defined.

The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a solution demonstrating how to handle custom data types to avoid sorting issues and ensure correctness. This solution involves defining an appropriate `Ord` instance for custom types and understanding how Haskell's `sort` function relies on the `Ord` typeclass.  We also discuss strategies for optimizing the performance of sorting for large datasets.  Properly addressing these nuances enhances code reliability and efficiency.
