```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```
This code snippet seems simple enough but it may lead to unexpected behavior if the `sort` function is not thoroughly understood.  The `sort` function uses a mergesort algorithm.  Mergesort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), which is generally quite efficient. However, the implementation can be susceptible to issues if the list contains elements that are difficult to compare or if the comparison function itself has hidden inefficiencies. For instance, in the case of custom data types where comparison is not properly defined, it might lead to runtime errors or unexpected sorting results.
